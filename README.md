# RoutePlanner
A public repo to be asked about having a look at my Route Planner app. This app is made via .NET C# forms. 

This app features an address autocomplete via HTTP requests to google maps API, and as well as caching of addresses on a MongoDB.

This app will also solve the Travelling Salesman Problem by planning an optimal route between the addresses.

Currently a WIP, but will show off what is currently done!
